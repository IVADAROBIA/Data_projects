| 1 | Return Rate Dashboard: Uncovering Patterns in Returns| This project involved developing a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to analyze return patterns for an e-commerce superstore. The goal was to identify key factors contributing to high return rates, including regional, seasonal, and product-specific trends. By visualizing metrics such as return rates, sales correlations, and customer behavior, the project provided actionable insights to optimize inventory management, improve operational efficiency, and minimize financial losses. |
